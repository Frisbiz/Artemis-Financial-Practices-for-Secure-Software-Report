# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report

Client Summary: Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required a vulnerability assessment of its software application. The company sought to ensure that its application was secure from potential threats and adhered to industry best practices for software security.

Software Security and Coding: I effectively identified and prioritized software security vulnerabilities, which is crucial in protecting the software from malicious attacks. Secure coding is vital because it prevents unauthorized access, ensuring the software's reliability and maintaining customer trust.

Challenges and Learnings: The most challenging aspect was distinguishing between false positives and actual vulnerabilities. This process was insightful as it deepened my understanding of software security and improved my ability to assess real threats.

Layered Security and Functionality: To increase security, I implemented multiple layers, including encryption and authentication methods. After refactoring the code, I performed rigorous testing to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the software remained fully functional.

Tools and Practices: I used tools like static code analyzers and dependency checkers to identify vulnerabilities, which will be valuable in future projects. These tools help maintain a high standard of security in software development.

Future Employer Showcase: This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and improve software security. I would present this work to future employers as evidence of my proficiency in secure software development and my ability to address complex security challenges.
